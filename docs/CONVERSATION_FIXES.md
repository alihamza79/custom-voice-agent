# Conversation Fixes

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Removed "For example" Responses**
- **Problem**: AI was saying "For example, you could say 'tomorrow at 2 PM' or 'next Monday at 10 AM'"
- **Solution**: Removed all "For example" phrases from responses to make them more natural

**Before:**
```
"I heard '5'. Is that the day of the month, or did you mean a time? Could you be more specific? For example, '5th of October' or '5 PM'?"
```

**After:**
```
"I heard '5'. Is that the day of the month, or did you mean a time? Could you be more specific?"
```

### **2. Fixed "I can't process this request" Error**
- **Problem**: When user says "I need help rescheduling" and then "yes", system says "I can't process this request"
- **Solution**: Added "I need help rescheduling" to the intent classification examples

**Before:**
```
User: "I need help rescheduling"
AI: [Starts delay workflow]
User: "Yes" 
AI: "I can't process this request" ‚ùå
```

**After:**
```
User: "I need help rescheduling"
AI: [Starts delay workflow]
User: "Yes"
AI: [Continues workflow properly] ‚úÖ
```

## üîß **Technical Changes**
