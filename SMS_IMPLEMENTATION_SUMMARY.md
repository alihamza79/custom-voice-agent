## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### 1. Call Ends
- LangGraph workflow completes with `endCall: true`
- `callTerminationService.endCall()` is called
- Call is successfully terminated

### 2. SMS Confirmation
- **Delay**: 1 second after call termination
- **Service**: `callTerminationService.sendConfirmationSMS()`
- **Recipient**: `+923450448426` (teammate)
- **Sender**: `+4915888648880` (your SMS number)

### 3. Message Generation
- **Service**: `smsService.sendAppointmentConfirmation()`
- **Templates**: Based on call outcome (confirmed, rescheduled, cancelled, etc.)
- **Data**: Customer name, appointment details, call duration

## 🚀 How It Works

### Customer Intent Node:
```javascript
// After call termination
setTimeout(async () => {
  await callTerminationService.sendConfirmationSMS(
    state.streamSid, 
    'confirmed', 
    callDuration
  );
}, 1000);
```

### Outbound Customer Verify Intent Node:
```javascript
// After call termination
setTimeout(async () => {
  await callTerminationService.sendConfirmationSMS(
    state.streamSid, 
    'customer_verification_completed', 
    callDuration
  );
}, 1000);
```

## 📊 Expected Results

After a call ends, the teammate at `+923450448426` will receive an SMS like:

```
✅ Appointment Confirmed

Customer: Arman
Appointment: Head checkup
Time: Monday, September 8, 2025 at 07:00 PM
Status: Confirmed by customer
Call Duration: 2m 30s
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify SMS service:
```bash
cd custom-voice-agent
node test-sms-service.js
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Environment Variables:
- `SMS_PHONE_NUMBER=+4915888648880` (your SMS number)
- `TEAMMATE_PHONE_NUMBER=+923450448426` (teammate number)
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` (existing)
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (existing)

### Optional Environment Variables:

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The SMS confirmation system is now fully integrated into the existing call flow without breaking any existing functionality. The system will automatically send SMS confirmations to teammates after calls end.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Add the environment variables to your `.env` file
2. Test the SMS service with the test script
3. Make a test call to verify SMS confirmation works
4. Monitor logs for SMS delivery status

The system is ready to use! 🚀
